## How it works

CSVs are automatically updated by a GitHub [action](/.github/workflows/update-csv.yml) from the [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qAN8Eh4iPjO1aECiO1tclTXTLKfCka3StReywLJ3A58/) which get saved at `/csv/`.

## Contributing

- You can upload decrypted `.ipa` files directly through the site for review.
- Contributions are reviewed and added to the archive.
