# Ultimate Roblox Mobile Archive Site

A fast, static viewer for archived Roblox iOS `.ipa` files — including official, HD, and developer builds.

- 📊 CSV-driven tables  
- ⚡ Simple and fast viewer
- 🌙 Mobile-friendly, dark UI  

## How it works

CSVs are automatically updated by a GitHub action from the [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qAN8Eh4iPjO1aECiO1tclTXTLKfCka3StReywLJ3A58/) which get saved at `/csv/`.
